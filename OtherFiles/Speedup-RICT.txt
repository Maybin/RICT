
Improve performance by
- Function call at registry level
- Check perormance by rProfiler or 
- Check profiling in Rstudio by "Profile"
- Use lapply, sapply, as optimised vectorised operations instead of FOR lops
- use data.table for large operations 
- Use  
library(foreach)
library(doSNOW)
library(parallel)
